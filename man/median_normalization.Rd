\title{Median Normalization of a Data Frame}
\usage{
median_normalization(df, id_col = "Glycopeptide")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the data to be normalized. It should include one identifier column and multiple numeric columns.}

\item{id_col}{A string specifying the name of the identifier column in \code{df} that should be excluded from normalization. Default is \code{"Glycopeptide"}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as \code{df} where the numeric columns have been normalized so that
their medians equal the global median computed from the original data.
}
\description{
This function performs median normalization on a data frame by adjusting each numeric column so that
its median becomes equal to the global median of all numeric column medians. The identifier column,
specified by \code{id_col}, is excluded from the normalization.
}
\details{
The normalization process involves the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Identify the numeric columns by excluding the specified identifier column.
\item Compute the median of each numeric column, ignoring \code{NA} values.
\item Calculate the global median of these column medians.
\item Normalize each numeric column by dividing each value by its column's median and then multiplying by the global median.

# demo
df <- data.frame(
  Glycopeptide = paste0("GP", 1:5),
  A = c(10, 20, 30, NA, 50),
  B = c(5, NA, 15, 25, 35),
  C = c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
)

# Perform median normalization
df_norm <- median_normalization(df, id_col = "Glycopeptide")
print(df_norm)
