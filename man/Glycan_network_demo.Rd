\format{
A data frame with 21 rows and 3 columns:
\describe{
\item{Annotated Sequence}{The annotated peptide sequence.}
\item{Glycan composition}{The glycan composition, e.g. \code{HexNAc(2)Hex(8)}.}
\item{Master Protein Accessions}{Protein accession identifiers (e.g., \code{Q8TCJ2}).}

\description{
This dataset provides a sample glycan network for demonstration, containing
columns such as \code{Annotated Sequence}, \code{Glycan composition}, and
\code{Master Protein Accessions}. It can be used to test or illustrate
glycan-related functions in the package.
}
\details{
Each row corresponds to a particular glycopeptide with its associated glycan
composition and the protein accession from which it originates. This dataset
can be loaded with:
