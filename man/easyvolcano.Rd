\title{Visualize easyDiff Results with a Volcano Plot}
\usage{
easyvolcano(
  diff,
  cutoff_fc = 1.2,
  cutoff_p = 0.05,
  top_marker = 0,
  max_overlaps = 0,
  Feature = "protein"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{diff}{The result of an \code{easydiff} analysis, provided as a tibble or data frame with fixed columns:
\code{Label}, \code{Protein}, \code{log2FC}, and \code{pvalue}. Each row represents a feature (e.g., a protein or metabolite),
with its identifier (Label), associated protein or group (Protein), log2 fold-change (log2FC), and p-value (pvalue) from the differential analysis.}

\item{cutoff_fc}{A numeric threshold for the fold-change cutoff (on the log2 scale). Features with an absolute log2 fold-change
greater than or equal to this value are considered to have significant fold changes. Default is \code{1.2}.}

\item{cutoff_p}{A numeric threshold for the significance level (p-value). Features with p-values less than or equal to this
threshold are considered statistically significant. Default is \code{0.05}.}

\item{top_marker}{An integer specifying the number of top significant features to label on the plot. The function will label
the \code{top_marker} features with the smallest p-values (most significant) in the volcano plot (e.g., use 10 to label the top 10 most significant features).}

\item{max_overlaps}{A value controlling the maximum number of overlapping labels allowed, passed to \code{ggrepel::geom_label_repel()}.
This helps avoid clutter by limiting how many labels overlap on the plot. Adjust this value to fine-tune label placement.}

\item{Feature}{A string indicating the type of feature being analyzed (e.g., \code{"protein"}, \code{"glycopeptide"}, \code{"metabolite"}).
This is used in plot annotations (such as axis labels or titles) to clarify what type of features are being visualized.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{pltvol1}}{A \code{ggplot2} object showing a standard volcano plot (log2 fold change on the x-axis
and -log10 p-value on the y-axis) of the \code{easydiff} results, with points highlighted based on significance and the top features labeled.}
\item{\code{pltvol2}}{A \code{ggplot2} object providing an alternative volcano plot visualization of the results (for example, a variation
in styling or labeling compared to \code{pltvol1}). This plot also highlights significant features and labels the top features.}
\item{\code{dt_vol}}{A filtered data frame (tibble) containing only the significant featuresâ€”those that meet the
\code{cutoff_fc} and \code{cutoff_p} thresholds. This can be used for further analysis or inspection of the significant features.}
}
}
\description{
\code{easyvolcano} generates volcano plots to visualize the output of differential analysis results from \code{easydiff}.
It highlights features (e.g., proteins, peptides, metabolites) that show significant changes between conditions,
based on specified fold-change and significance thresholds.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Suppose `diff_results` is a tibble from an easyDiff analysis:
diff_results <- easydiff(diff.matrix.log2trans, contrast.matrix,groups,sample_info)

# Generate volcano plots with default thresholds and label top 10 proteins:
volcano_output <- easyvolcano(diff_results, cutoff_fc = 1.2, cutoff_p = 0.05, top_marker = 10, Feature = "protein")

# The result is a list. We can display the two volcano plots:
print(volcano_output$pltvol1)  # Primary volcano plot
print(volcano_output$pltvol2)  # Alternative volcano plot

# View the data frame of significant features:
head(volcano_output$dt_vol)
}
